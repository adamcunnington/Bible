## Setup
The application can be executed in two ways:
1. Locally
2. Via Docker

### 1. Local Instructions
The application can be ran locally (in editable mode) which is especially useful if changes are being made to the code. The `make` commands in this section assume an executable called `python3.9`. Alternatively, `PYTHON3=x` can be passed with the make target where `x` is the name of the python3 executable to use, e.g. `PYTHON3=python3.7`. Run `make` to see full details.

#### Pre Requisites
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install makefile dependencies, python3.x and python3.x-dev and build-essential packages (required by python-levenshtein).
3. Set the `ESV_API_TOKEN` environment variable (either explicitly or implicitly via a ./.env file). To obtain an API token, visit [ESV API documentation](https://api.esv.org/docs/).

#### Installation
1. Install the application locally (a virtual environment will be created) with `make install`.

#### Execution
1. Run the application locally with `make run-local`.

---

### 2. Docker Instructions
The application can also be ran inside of a docker container. No dependencies are required other than docker.

#### Pre Requisites
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install docker.
3. Set the `ESV_API_TOKEN` environment variable, locally (either explicitly or implicitly via a ./.env file). To obtain an API token, visit [ESV API documentation](https://api.esv.org/docs/).

#### Installation
1. Build the docker image with `make build`.

#### Execution
1. Run an ephemeral container using the docker image with `make run`.

## Usage
The execution of the application, whether locally or via Docker, starts a python interpreter with the bible package already imported. Translations should be accessed directly through the bible namespace, e.g. `bible.esv`. All attributes are accessed through the `Translation` object directly, or indirectly via descendent objects.

### Core API
There are 5 main objects in the core API:
* `Translation` (e.g. ESV)
* `Book` (e.g. Genesis)
* `Chapter` (e.g. Chapter 1 of Genesis)
* `Verse` (e.g. Verse 1 of Genesis 1)
* `Passage` (e.g. range of verses from 1 or more chapters/books)

[Two tables at the end of this section](#attribute-support) provide an overview of what is available through the core API. The first lists all attributes and which objects they are supported by whilst the second provides information for each attribute as well as details of any object-specific behaviour.

Each translation is responsible for providing both the metadata and content for the translation. Additionally, each translation may extend the core API (or even override, sparingly) to surface extra content or functionality (such as using an online concordance service).

For now, it suffices to say that the first four objects should be seen as a hierarcy, e.g. start with a `Translation` and dive into a `Book`, then `Chapter`, then `Verse` - much like a physical Bible. The fifth, `Passage` object, can be generated by using the `passage()` method on any object that has children (e.g. all but `Verse`) and passing a reference which identifies the range to generate.

#### Passage References
The convention that passage references must follow is consistent across `Translations`, `Books` and `Chapters` but the form minimises as the parent object is scoped down. It is easier to describe the form per parent:

```
Translation.passage(reference=None, int_reference=None)
```
* *reference* - takes the form, `<book> <chapter>:<verse> - <book> <chapter>:<verse>` where spaces are optional, each component is optional, book can be a number, fuzzy matched sluggified name or even fuzzy matched alternative name, and chapter/verse should be numbers. If a component is omitted from the left hand side, it will be assumed to be 1 whereas if a component is omitted from the right hand side, it will be assumed to be the final entity of whatever was omitted. This assumption cascades such that the extreme case of *reference=*`-` will actually return a `Passage` object that spans the entire Bible - from Genesis 1:1 to the final verse of the final chapter of the final book. It is also possible to return a single book/chapter/verse by omitting the right hand side entirely as well as the `-` character. If provided, the right hand side must be greater than the left.
* *int_reference* - takes a simplified form, `XXYYYZZZ - XXYYYZZZ` where spaces are optional, XX is an optionally 0-padded book number (i.e. both 6 and 06 are acceptable), YYY is a 00-padded chapter number and ZZZ is a 00-padded verse number. For example, `Genesis 1:1 - Exodus 3:6` would be represented as `01001001 - 02003006`. Each side is optional but the component parts that make up the side are not. If provided, the right hand side must be canonically after the left hand side.

```
Book.passage(reference="-")
```
* *reference* - behaves exactly as *reference* above except it takes the simplified form, `<chapter>:<verse> - <chapter>:<verse>` as the book comes implicitly from the parent object.

```
Chapter.passage(reference="-")
```
* *reference* - behaves exactly as *reference* above except it takes the simplified form, `<verse> - <verse>` as the chapter and book come implicitly from the parent object.

### ESV API Specifics
For the most part, the ESV translation sticks to the core API. The following additions apply.

#### Translation Object Extensions
```
Translation.search(query, page_size=100)
```
Search the bible for verses that are related to the query and return a generator.
* *query* - a word or phrase to search for.

#### Text Object Addition
Calling the *text()* method on any object that supports it will return a `Text` object with the following attributes:

```
len(Text) -> len(Text.body.split())
```
```
repr(Text) -> Text.body
```
```
Text.body -> String text body
```
```
Text.footnotes -> String footnotes
```
```
Text.title -> String title (where relevant, and typically only first verses)
```

## Developing Translations
Adding a translation to the codebase entails 3 tasks:
1. Create a python package under `bible/translations/`
2. Create the translation-specific metadata under `bible/translations/<translation>/data.json`
3. Add the loading of the translation to `bible/__init__.py`

Each of these tasks will be explored in greater detail. It is useful to refer to bible/translations/esv/ as an existing example.

### 1. New Python Package
At minimum, the new translation should consist of:
```
bible/translations/<translation>/__init__.py - empty file
bible/translations/<translation>/api.py - this file name is mandatory and this is where the logic will sit
```

In `api.py`, the `Translation`, `Book`, `Chapter`, `Verse` and `Passage` classes from `bible.api` should be inherited and implementations should be provided for the `text()` and `audio()` methods. Typically, content for these will come from 3rd party API services. Optionally, extensions to the API can also be made.

It is likely that additional environment variables will be required to accommodate API secrets and possibly additional python dependencies too. Therefore, it is expected that the following files in the root of the project may also need changing accordingly:
- `Dockerfile`
- `README.md`
- `requirements.txt`
- `Makefile`

### 2. Translation-Specific Metadata
The python package alone is not enough. Each translation must provide metadata for the bible structure (as there are subtle variations between translations) and characters.

The base metadata is defined in `bible/data.json`. Translation-specific metadata must be provided at `bible/translations/<translation>/data.json` and is merged with precedence into the base metadata. The properties that relate to the bible book structures are self explanatory - refer to `bible/translations/esv/data/structure.json` for a more concrete example.

Regarding character metadata, the below table details the properties available - all of which are optional except for *passages*.

| Field Name         | Type              | Description                                                                           | Example                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| name               | string            | The primary name the character is known by.                                           | "Jesus"                       |
| aliases            | array of strings  | Alternative names the character is known by.                                          | ["Son of Man", "Cornerstone"] |
| mother             | integer           | The identifier (`<n>`) of the mother character.                                       | 5                             |
| father             | integer           | The identifier (`<n>`) of the mother character.                                       | 4                             |
| spouses            | array of integers | The identifiers (`<n>`)s of the character's husbands/wives.                           | []                            |
| nationality        | string            | The place/nation where the character is considerd to be from. Often not birthplace.   | "Nazareth"                    |
| born               | integer           | The year the character was born. Negative number for BC, positive for AD.             | 0                             |
| age                | integer           | The age the character died/left earth at.                                             | 35                            |
| died               | integer           | The year the character died. Negative number for BC, positive for AD.                 | 35                            |
| cause_of_death     | enum              | A string (from a consistent list) that describes how the character died.              | "Crucified"                   |
| place_of_death     | enum              | A string (from a consistent list) that describes where the character died.            | "Golgotha"                    |
| primary_occupation | enum              | A string (from a consistent list) that describes the character's main job / passtime. | "Carpenter/Savior!"           |
| passages           | array of strings  | Each item should be a [valid Translation.passage reference](#passage-references).     | ["Matthew"]                   |

For *passages*, it can be difficult to know how to accurately represent the range of passages that refer to a particular character. The following rule serves as useful guidance:
* If the character is seldom mentioned (e.g. Melchizedek), then a list of very specific verses is most appropriate.
* If the character is described in the context of a story, limit the specifity to entire chapters or even entire books if appropriate (e.g. Jesus).

### 3. Loading the Translation
This is the simplest step. `bible/__init__.py` should be altered in two ways:
- An additional import will be needed; `import bible.translations.<translation>`
- An additional global object will be added; `<translation> = utils.load_translation(bible.translations.<translation>.__name__)`

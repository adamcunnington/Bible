TO FIX
    audio! And update installation documentation.

    fix regex pattern for text (title not working properly - see genesis 1:17). Also, we are now included verse numbers so regex pattern may need completely reviewing

    It sucks that the metadata must be repeated across translations because of the subtle variations in passages. It would be better to centralise as much of this as possible even if it adds some complexity. Look into this.

CHARACTERS
    We need to ignore character.json when merging characters.

ARCHITECTURE
    Can we make the translations more self-contained and modular? E.g. can we avoid altering bible/__init__.py to register a new translation? Can we pip install translations separately?

IDEAS for structure.json

TO FIX
    Get display working for docker container.

    It sucks that the metadata must be repeated across translations because of the subtle variations in passages. It would be better to centralise as much of this as possible even if it adds some complexity. Look into this but not until adding second translation.

FUNCTIONALITY
    Bind display to docker container (like we do for audio).

    Finessee tree() method. Add different type of line for spouses.

    Make text more terminal print friendly.

CHARACTERS
    Don't forget to update docs.

    Need to map nationalities to modern day equivelants

MAKE ENTERPRISE (all require make target updates)
    Docstrings
    Type hints

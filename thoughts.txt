TO FIX
    audio! And update installation documentation.

    the .books, .chapters, .verses properties should have a consistent interface. e.g. always return a generator. Therefore, they should always be methods then, not properties. Update all references (contains etc)

    dataclasses

    fix regex pattern for text (title not working properly - see genesis 1:17). Also, we are now included verse numbers so regex pattern may need completely reviewing


IDEAS for base.json
    when the book was written

ADDITIONS to README.md
    Should introduce the 5 main objects; translation, book, chapter, verse, passage.
    
    Provide a table which shows every method/attribute, description and then checkbox for which object supports it.

    Consider removing make install step and going straight to make run

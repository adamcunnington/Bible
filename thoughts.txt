TO FIX
    It sucks that the metadata must be repeated across translations because of the subtle variations in passages. It would be better to centralise as much of this as possible even if it adds some complexity. Look into this but not until adding second translation.

    Get display working for docker container.

FUNCTIONALITY
    Finessee tree() method.

    Bind display to docker container (like we do for audio).

    Make text more terminal print friendly.

CHARACTERS
    character["ada"] using levenhstein
    also, implement .like() method using levenhstein
    method on character to find out how they are related to x. should return from the character's perspective. e.g. x is my <relation>. Might get very complicated!

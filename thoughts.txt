TO FIX
    It sucks that the metadata must be repeated across translations because of the subtle variations in passages. It would be better to centralise as much of this as possible even if it adds some complexity. Look into this.

FUNCTIONALITY
    Integrate anytree for visualising genealogy. Currently have open question here; https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree/issues/151. If we are stuck with single parent, will have to be inventive with the methods we expose to give user flexibility. Also, might need some extra attribute such as "main" or "dominant" or something so we know to use them for the parent of a child when there is ambiguity.

IDEAS for data.json
    When the book was written.

    Add character gender.

    Convert some character string properties to enums? Where should the list be mastered?

ADDITIONS to README.md
    Populate overview (about the application, quick install, quick usage)

    Add a pip install alternative to the makefile route?

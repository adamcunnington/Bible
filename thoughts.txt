TO FIX
    It sucks that the metadata must be repeated across translations because of the subtle variations in passages. It would be better to centralise as much of this as possible even if it adds some complexity. Look into this.

ARCHITECTURE
    Can we make the translations more self-contained and modular? E.g. can we avoid altering bible/__init__.py to register a new translation? Can we pip install translations separately?

IDEAS for data.json
    When the book was written.

CHARACTER
    Integrate anytree for visualising genealogy. Currently have open question here; https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree/issues/151

    Convert some string properties to enums? Where should the list be mastered?

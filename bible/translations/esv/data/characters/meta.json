/// Comments
What rules should we have for determining when a given passage should be a range or list of occurences?
How do we explicitly identify when a character is first talked about and last talked about.
At the end of each book, we should identify all characters who have one or more passages that reference/cross the book, and ensure all details are finished. That way, if we come across them again, we know to append a passage.

/// Comments
How do we uniquely identify a record beyond explicitly referencing an index? This applies to mother and father too.
Should we capture any other details?
What rules should we have for determining when a given passage should be a range or list of occurences?
How do we explicitly identify when a character is first talked about and last talked about.
At the end of each book, we should identify all characters who have one or more passages that reference/cross the book, and ensure all details are finished. That way, if we come across them again, we know to append a passage.
